  <h2 class="top">About</h2>
  <p>Occupy.here is a free, anonymous, and uncensored resource for you and your neighbors. You can post messages, share media files, and occupy the virtual space here as you wish.</p>
  <h2>You are not on the internet</h2>
  <p>You are connected to a wifi router that’s been hacked to connect you to other people nearby. You are “offline” in relation to the rest of the Internet, but “online” in a way that connects you to others within range of the wifi signal.</p>
  <!--<h2>Occupy.here is a network</h2>
  <p>While this wifi router is not directly wired to any upstream network provider, it’s also not entirely isolated. There is another way that data can be transmitted to other occupy.here routers. The router’s local database has been quietly backed up onto your browser. Upon connecting to another Occupy.here router, the data you’ve carried with you will be synced and merged into that node’s database.</p>
  <p>Messages can propagate across the network, but your device is the conduit instead of an upstream ISP. The network of Occupy.here routers is very loosely connected, data moves slowly using a process that resembles insects polinating flowers.</p>-->
  <h2>Named, anonymous accounts</h2>
  <p>On Occupy.here you post anonymously like with weblog comments. You have a named account, but there is no password or verification process. Content you post here may be copied to other Occupy.here wifi routers.</p>
  <h2>Help us build Occupy.here</h2>
  <p>Occupy.here is all-volunteer, <a href="https://github.com/dphiffer/occupy.here" class="off-site">open source</a>, and <a href="http://www.fsf.org/" class="off-site">Free Software</a>. <a href="http://phiffer.org/" class="off-site">Dan Phiffer</a> is the founder and lead developer, with contributions from <a href="http://boxysean.com/" class="off-site">Sean McIntyre</a> and GitHub user <a href="https://github.com/Phaeilo" class="off-site">Phaeilo</a>. In 2012 the project was fortunate to receive  a commissions grant from <a href="http://rhizome.org/" class="off-site">Rhizome</a>.</p>
  <h2>Setting up your own router</h2>
  <p>Occupy.here is designed to be replicated. You can install the custom OpenWRT image on your own router. Visit <a href="http://occupyhere.org" class="off-site">occupyhere.org</a> for the step-by-step installation guide.</p>
