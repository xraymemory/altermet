AlterMet is an installation based on the Occupy.Here code,
written by the inestimable Daniel Phiffer (http://occupyhere.org/).

You need to set up Occupy.Here before the AlterMet will be functional.
The public/ directory contains the AlterMet content which is served
by the Occupy.Here broadcasting router.

Stay chill.
