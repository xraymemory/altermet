#ALTERMET // FEMET#

AlterMet is a custom wi-fi hijacker for the Metropolitan Museum developed at the Met Media Lab. Femet is a digital installation utilizing the AlterMet platform as well as video and sculptural elements. They were [presented at the Metropolitan Media Lab Expo](http://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/digital-underground/2015/the-medialab-fall-2014-expo) in December 2014

Seventy-six percent of painted women in the Met are nude. Less than four percent of the exhibited artists at the Met are female. Femet creates an SSID that mimics the Met's so when users log on to the wireless network, all their traffic is intercepted and rerouted to display only images by female artists in the Met's collection.

The AlterMet software is a variant of the OccupyHere software written by the inestimable Daniel Phiffer (http://occupyhere.org/).

The `public/` directory contains the FeMet content which is served by the broadcasting router.
