# ALTERMET // FemMET 

AlterMet is a custom wi-fi hijacker for the Metropolitan Museum developed at the Met Media Lab. FemMet is a digital installation utilizing the AlterMet platform as well as video and sculptural elements. Less than four percent of the exhibited artists at the Met are female, so FemMet impersonates a Metropolitan Museum of Art WiFi access point: when the user connects, all internet requests are rerouted to archival images of Met artworks by female-identifying artists. 

The two projects were [presented in tandem at the Metropolitan Media Lab Expo](https://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/digital-underground/2015/the-medialab-fall-2014-expo) in December 2014

The AlterMet software is a variant of the OccupyHere software written by the inestimable Daniel Phiffer (http://occupyhere.org/).

The `public/` directory contains the FeMet content which is served by the broadcasting router.
